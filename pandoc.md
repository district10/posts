# Euclidean distance in various coordinate systems

The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.[^37] If $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by

$$\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}.$$

More generally, in Euclidean n-space, the Euclidean distance between two points, $A\,=\,(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$ and $B\,=\,(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)$, is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as:

$$\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2}.$$
